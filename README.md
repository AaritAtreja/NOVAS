## NOVAS
We present our submission for the 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge: NOVAS

NOVAS is an innovative app based platform and buisness model responding to the currently pressing, and exponentially increasing problem of space debris in Lower Earth Orbit.

NOVAS has two components: Debris Detection and Removal

NOVAS can be accessed at the url: "nova.impactfuture.us"

## Debris Detection

NOVAS's debris detection network operates of a collection of data from NASA, and SpaceTrack.org, along with having simulated computer vision and crowd sourcing detection capabilities to supplement these sources.

Any individual or entity which operates in LEO, can use NOVAS's debris detection to reduce accidents and improve saftey, while reducing maintence costs. Additionally, NOVAS is able to increase the reliability and consistency of the success of ventures in LEO. This NOVAS debris detection platform will be offered as a subscription model.

Debris is visualized in many different ways, one of which is the "Orbital View" providing an interactive display which users can click to reveal specific sattelite information. Information is displayed in the "Object Information" window.
Another way for users to interact with data is the "threat warnings" which display the most likeley debris which based on velocity, period, eccnetricity, current location and more variables has the highest probability result in a collision with a simulated user object, and track when this would happen.
Additionally, individuals can visualize these impactful threats with the "Orbital Collision" view to visualize the current placement of such objects.
Users also can chat with the "NOVA AI Assistant" to learn more information about specific threats and bodies in space in general.
Users can also view a real-time camera onboard their satelite with the live Computer Vision debris detection, labeled, "Live CV", and can also report and identify new threats or entities in general to be added to the tracking system.

## Debris Removal

If an individual does find they want to adress a predicted collision, they can do so with NOVAS Debris removal.

NOVAS's debris removal is a service that is offered as a transactional purchase model, and can be initated by the clicking of the "Deploy Interceptor" when displaying threats in the "Object Information" display by clicking on specific objects in the "Threat Analysis" display. 

From there, our object removal module is deployed to intercept the object, and will, upon reaching the object, deorbit itself, release the object, then re-orbit itself with the use of an ion engine.
